**Overview of the project**

**Project: Student Grade System**
A graphical user interface (GUI) application for managing student grades. The application allows users to add grades for different subjects and calculate the average grade, GPA, and letter grade for a student.

**Features**
Add grades for different subjects
Calculate average grade, GPA, and letter grade
Display results in a GUI window
Error handling for invalid input

**Usage**
Run the script using Python (e.g. python student_grades_manager.py)
A GUI window will appear with input fields for student name, subject, and grade
Enter the required information and click the "Add Grade" button to add a grade
Click the "Calculate Average" button to calculate the average grade, GPA, and letter grade
The results will be displayed in the GUI window

**Code Structure**
The code is organized into a single class StudentGrades which contains all the functionality
The class has several methods:
  __init__: Initializes the GUI window and input fields
  add_grade: Adds a grade to the database
  calculate_average: Calculates the average grade, GPA, and letter grade
  calculate_gpa: Calculates the GPA and letter grade based on the average grade
The code uses Tkinter's event-driven programming model, where button clicks trigger method calls

**Requirements**
Python 3.x
Tkinter library (included with Python)
